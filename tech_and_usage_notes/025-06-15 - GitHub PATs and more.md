# 2025-06-15 - GitHub PATs and more  

- What a confused mess trying to figure out how to set up GitHub PATs and how to set them up for use.
- What confuses me is building a mental model of where credentials are stored, used, modified, etc.

- What I did today:  
	- apparently re-generated the "bsky-comments" PAT
	- installed `git-credential-manager`
		- this seems to have removed an existing gitPAT from `.git-credentials`
		- DONE: recover old file from TimeMachine (and put aside)
	- now I do not know where the current credential is stored  
	-
