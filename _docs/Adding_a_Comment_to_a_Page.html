      <h1>Adding a Comment to a Page</h1>
<p>We suggest a way to add a comment inline in a page.</p>
<p>The idea is to use a quoted block and (perhaps) your name, and then add your comments.</p>
<p>For replies, you can add another quote level (line starts with <code>&gt; &gt; </code>).</p>
<p>Consider a passage of text like the following.</p>
<h2>Example Source Text</h2>
<p>I think we can level up from being an oral culture that thinks big thoughts but doesn't do much else together, to being a culture that uses technologies like reading and writing and drawing to create persistent artifacts and thinking spaces.</p>
<p>one of the collective wishes we have is "wouldn't it be cool if an expert or a genius took our calls and made something wonderful out of them?"</p>
<p>while I don't disagree with that wish, I think we can get a <strong>lot</strong> of the same value by doing that making ourselves.  <em>and</em>, that we would learn more and think more together, by doing it ourselves, rather than depending on an external specialist to do it for us.  and heck, some of <em>us</em> might become experts and geniuses at distilling knowledge and wisdom, if only we started practicing what we wish for!</p>
<h2>Source Text With Inline Comments</h2>
<p>I think we can level up from being an oral culture that thinks big thoughts but doesn't do much else together, to being a culture that uses technologies like reading and writing and drawing to create persistent artifacts and thinking spaces.</p>
<p>one of the collective wishes we have is "wouldn't it be cool if an expert or a genius took our calls and made something wonderful out of them?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Ondine) You note this has been said about calls; I feel that the same can be said about conversations in other media, as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Viktor) Thanks, Ondine, I totally agree.  I would love to have a clever editor to go over my various scribblings...</p>
