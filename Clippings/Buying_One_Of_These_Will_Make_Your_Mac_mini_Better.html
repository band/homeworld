<p>The M4 Mac mini is one of the best home computers ever made, thanks to a combination of the incredibly powerful M4 chip, a compact design and a very reasonable price. But you can make it even better with a Mac mini dock, hub or whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>A Mac mini dock allows you to expand the number of ports your device has while also acting as an external SSD enclosure to increase your storage. In a world where Apple charges mega bucks for storage space and can be stingy with ports beyond providing USB-C, third-party Mac mini docks are excellent value options and an essential part of any Mac mini setup.</p>
<p>I’ve compiled a list of the best Mac mini docks I’ve tested, with something for everyone from the most ports to budget-friendly options. There’s also my overall favourite, which balances value with connectivity, storage capacity and brand reliability. Take your pick!</p>
<h2>Why do you need a dock for the M4 Mac mini?</h2>
<p>There are a few reasons why I just said that a Mac mini dock is essential. The most obvious one is that the M4 Mac mini doesn’t come with any USB-A ports. That means you can’t connect any wired peripherals that use USB-A without an adapter, which is just very annoying.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is also no SD or micro-SD card slot, meaning you need to use an external reader if you are working with image or video files. Again, whilst not the end of the world, it’s much easier to have one built in rather than needing to always have your SD card reader with you.</p>
<p>Mac mini docks also allow you to expand internal storage without connecting a wired external SSD. The SSD enclosures included in the Mac mini docks below mean you can add up to 8TB of storage in some cases, which is much cheaper than buying it all from Apple.</p>
<p>Got it? Good! Let’s get into the recommendations.</p>
<h2>Best Overall: Satechi Mac mini M4 Stand &amp; Hub</h2>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*Wdo135vCnACWuOH7" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://little.getsquirrel.co/best-deal/314/13207885">Satechi Mac mini hub</a> does everything most people need it to for a reasonable price. Put simply, that’s why it’s my number one pick.</p>
<p>First off, it’s the Mac mini dock I have the most experience with. I’ve been using it ever since it was released in 2024 and haven’t run into a single issue. Some people have reported WiFi connectivity problems but it’s been totally fine for me, so I can’t fault it there. All the Mac mini hubs on this list are great, I just feel the most comfortable recommending Satechi because I know the brand so well.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*Y5Ob3WPLaBgOC_Fj" alt="" /></p>

<p>The design is very simple, like most Mac mini docks, with a small gap between the Mac mini to allow for cooling and a cutout to enable access to the power button. Yes, if having to move the M4 Mac mini to be able to turn it on or off annoyed you, then a Mac mini dock solves that problem.</p>
<p>When plugged into your Mac mini, the Satechi provides you with two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports operating at 10 Gbps speeds and one USB-A 2.0 port at 480 Mbps. The SD Card slot has a read/write speed of 312 Mb/s, which is relatively fast compared to most of the others on this list, and the SSD enclosure supports up to 4TB of storage.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*6Y8RX4Kxwj8U_8DE" alt="" /></p>

<p>You get all of that for $99/£99, which is an undeniable bargain and cheaper than most of the other options on this list.</p>
<h2>Best Video Output: UGREEN Mac mini Dock M4</h2>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*utTkagK70pCL_5iV" alt="" /></p>
<p>Image courtesy of the author.</p>
<p>I’m yet to find a UGREEN product I don’t like, and their Mac mini dock is no different.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, you get <em>four</em> 10 Gbps USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports and one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port again with 10 Gbps speeds. It also has a rear-facing headphone jack and space for a whopping 8TB SSD.</p>
<p>But what sets it apart is the display port which supports output up for displays up to 4K@240Hz. This is limited to the M4 Pro Mac mini models, but no other hub around this price has this capability, so if video output is important to you, then the <a href="https://little.getsquirrel.co/best-deal/314/13207887">UGREEN M4 Mac mini hub</a> is ideal.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*-QOx7gTuXQ7Ljz90" alt="" /></p>
<p>Image courtesy of the author.</p>
<p>There are some very minor drawbacks. For example, you get an SD Card slot and a micro-SD card slot, something the Satechi doesn’t have, but the speed is slower at 104 Mb/s. Not a huge deal for most people, but it is something to think about if you regularly need to dump large image/video files.</p>
<p>It also requires two of the existing USB-C ports on the Mac mini to connect, so if you really need maximum USB-C connectivity, it might be a tad annoying. But other than that, it is an excellent Mac mini accessory for $119/£119.</p>
<h2>Best Connectivity: UGREEN Revodok Max 213</h2>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*0vWMbP0ssouXXjlw" alt="" /></p>
<p>Image courtesy of the author.</p>
<p>Hey, look, it’s UGREEN again! I wasn’t lying when I said before about how good their stuff is.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, the <a href="https://little.getsquirrel.co/best-deal/314/13207888">Revodo Max 213</a> isn’t a dock where the Mac mini sits on top of it; it’s a standalone device that serves the sole purpose of increasing the number of ports you have.</p>
<p>There is no built-in SSD slot, it takes up a bit more space on your desk than the other docks on this list and it doesn’t solve the power button ‘issue’.</p>
<p><em>But</em>, it is an excellent accessory that has every port you could wish for, vastly expanding what you can connect to your Mac mini. In terms of data ports, you get two Thunderbolt 4 (40Gbps), one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps, 20W PD), two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps) and 2× USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps).</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*QEvq5pQJpwdfVLAI" alt="" /></p>
<p>Image courtesy of the author.</p>
<p>On top of that, there’s a headphone jack, an Ethernet port and SD and micro-SD card readers with fast 320 MB/s speeds. The DipslayPort 1.4 supports up to 8K@30Hz or dual monitors up to 4K@60Hz which is ideal if you’re working in video editing or graphic design. To finish it off, the Revodok Max 213 can also power devices via most of its ports with 90W charging.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course, the non-Mac-mini-specific design means you can use it for other PCs too.</p>
<p>At $299/£359, it is undoubtedly a power user option, but if that is you, boy is it a great bit of kit!</p>
<h2>Budget Friendly: Qwiizlab UH60 Pro</h2>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*mzopTksGnshmgt81" alt="" /></p>
<p>Image courtesy of Qwiizlab.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to save the most amount of money but still want a functional Mac mini dock, the <a href="https://little.getsquirrel.co/best-deal/314/13207889">Qwiizlab UH60 Pro</a> is a great option.</p>
<p>It might not have all the ports that some others offer, but what you get for $88/£88 is perfectly reasonable, and that is ostensibly two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, one USB-A 2.0 port, an SD and micro-SD card reader and up to 8TB SSD. Oh, and the speed of the SD card reader is a very respectable 312MB/s.</p>
<p>The design is slightly different too, with a raised platform to ensure maximum airflow for cooling.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> some concessions. There’s no USB-C port for data transfer or any other ports like HDMI or a headphone jack. But you get what you pay for and if all you need is a few extra USB-A ports and space for an SSD, then the Qwiizlab is a sound choice for the money.</p>
<h2>Honourable Mention: Minisopuru iExpandMate</h2>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*SfZ2IzWR0Gg-Es22" alt="" /></p>
<p>Image courtesy of the author.</p>
<p>There isn’t anything inherently wrong with the <a href="https://little.getsquirrel.co/best-deal/314/13207892">Minisopuru iExpandMate</a>, it does exactly the same things as the others on this list and if you looked at the others and still wanted another option, this is absolutely one to consider.</p>
<p>It has three USB-A ports, a very handy HDMI output supporting 4K@60fps, a headphone jack and an SD/micro-SD reader. The only drawback is that the speed of the USB-A and SD Card ports is the slowest on this list. Now, that isn’t a huge problem for the average user but if you’re doing serious production work on your Mac mini, then it might be a bottleneck that you can’t live with.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*aHkDrddleqiL-Lba" alt="" /></p>
<p>Image courtesy of the author.</p>
<p>It is also $129/£100, so on the more expensive end of the scale. Interestingly, there is a vertical version of the iExpandMate where the Mac mini docks on its side, standing tall instead of flat, which has faster USB-A ports and a USB-C port for the same price, which might be worth checking out if you prefer that form factor.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So there you have it, my list of the best M4 Mac mini docks. In truth, all on this list are worthy purchases, it’s just a case of working out which combination of ports and other features stack up with your needs and budget.</p>
<p>Either way, owning a Mac mini dock is something I strongly recommend as it makes using one so much easier and more expansive. If you haven’t bought one yet, pick one and go for it!</p>
